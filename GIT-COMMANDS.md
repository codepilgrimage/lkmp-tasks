### Comman GIT Commands
1. To check the last commit that affected a specific file in Git, the following command can be used:
   ```bash
   git log -1 <file_path>
   ```
   - **git log:** This is the primary command for viewing commit history.
   - **-1:** This option limits the output to only the most recent commit.
   - **<file_path>:** This should be replaced with the actual path to the file whose last commit is to be checked.
